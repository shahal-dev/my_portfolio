## Overview

Nuptial-Link is a company that develops software for blockchain-based marriage registration. We believe that blockchain technology can revolutionize the way marriage records are managed, making them more secure, efficient, and transparent. Our software provides a secure and immutable ledger for storing marriage records, which can be accessed by authorized users from anywhere in the world. We also offer a variety of features that make it easy for users to register their marriages, including online registration, e-signatures, and automatic notifications. We are committed to providing our users with the best possible experience, and we are excited to be at the forefront of this new technology.
## Key Features

- **Solana BlockChain Integration**: Developed a custom Figma plugin that extracts design tokens such as colors, typography, and spacing values, and exports them in a format compatible with our codebase.
- **NFT Generation**: Integrated an automated process that translates Figma components into React code using a combination of design tokens and pre-built component templates. This allowed developers to focus more on logic and less on repetitive UI coding.
- **Fast and low cost transection **: Established a CI/CD pipeline that continuously synchronizes design changes from Figma to the codebase, ensuring design updates are reflected instantly without manual intervention.
- **Scalable Design System**: Leveraged a design system that remains the single source of truth for both designers and developers, making it easy to maintain consistency even as the product evolves.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma API**: For extracting design tokens and component data directly from the Figma designs.
- **React and Next.js**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **Styled-Components**: For managing styles dynamically using design tokens.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that the generated code was clean and maintainable. This involved setting up intelligent mapping between Figma components and React code structures, as well as managing edge cases like responsive design and conditional rendering. Additionally, the continuous synchronization required a robust error-handling system to prevent conflicts during development.

## Outcome

The automated Figma to code pipeline has streamlined the handoff process, cutting down design-to-development time by 40%. Designers now have more confidence that their designs will be accurately translated into code, and developers can focus on more complex logic and feature development. This project has proven the value of automation in bridging the gap between design and development.
